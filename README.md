## Advent of Code 2016

During 2017, I had chosen [Advent Of Code 2016](http://adventofcode.com/2016) to have some fun by coding.

Also, I had set some personal rules: 
1. every code should be written (mostly) in imperative style;
2. every code should be written in (modern) C++ or C;
3. I could you use only the [Standard Template Library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Template_Library) (STL) as facility, no other C or C++ library.

So, right now I've decided to share my experience in this repository. Enjoy!
